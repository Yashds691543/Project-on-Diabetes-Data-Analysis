# Project-on-Diabetes-Data-Analysis
Python-based diabetes project, you conducted a comprehensive analysis of a diabetes dataset.

In this project, we focused on analyzing and predicting diabetes outcomes based on several key health indicators such as Blood Pressure, Insulin levels, Age Group, and BMI. Using Python, we employed various mathematical tools and machine learning techniques to process and understand the data. We began by cleaning and preparing the dataset, including encoding categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding. We then used StandardScaler to normalize the features, ensuring they were on a comparable scale.

Following data preprocessing, we applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, which helped in simplifying the model without losing significant information. We also used dummy classifiers and performed cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance, specifically focusing on the F1 macro score.

Throughout the project, we generated various plots and visualizations to better understand the data distributions and the relationships between variables, which were crucial in refining the model and improving its accuracy. These steps reflect our proficiency in Python and our ability to leverage data science techniques for meaningful insights in health-related domains.
